	(1,'SC3542EE','Regelsystemen','The course presents time- and frequency domain control design methodologies for single input and single output dynamical systems. Feedforward- and feedback control methods aim at changing the dynamical properties in a desired manner. This first of all requires the specification of the design criteria in terms of closed-loop system performance, like overshoot, settling time, etc. as well as the understanding of the effect of a feedback controller on the system stability. Second after the closed-loop performance specifications different design methodologies of a PID controller will be analysed. In the time domain we have pole placement controller design and root locus methods and in the frequency domain we analyse the loop shaping approach. This method especially focusses on the robustness of the controller to cope with differences between the model and the true plant. The course will present both the fundamental aspects behind these methodologies as well as illustrate their use in concrete case studies.','Formulate the closed-loop performance specifications in both time- and frequency domain. Apply the design rules for tuning a PID controller. In the time domain this is done by the application of the pole placement method or the root locus method.

	(24,'WI4209','Systems and Control','The main objects of study in this course are systems modeled by linear time-invariant differential equations. We start with a treatment of the theory of algebraic representation of dynamical systems using polynomial matrices. The main tool is the Euclidean algorithm applied to matrices of real polynomials. The main result is a complete characterization of all representations of a given system. Several other representation are introduced along with their relations. Important examples of such representation are input-output representations that reveal that some variables may be unrestricted by the equations, and state space representations that visualize the separation of past and future, also referred to as the Markov property. Controllability and observability are important system theoretic concepts.  A controllable system has the property that a desired future behavior can always be obtained, independent of the past behavior, provided that this future behavior is compatible with the laws of the system. Observability means that the complete behavior may be reconstructed from incomplete observations. The theory of controllability and observability forms one of the highlights of the course. Stability can be an important and desirable property of a system. Stabilization by static or dynamic feedback is one of the key features of Systems and Control. In the pole placement theorem linear algebraic methods and the notion of controllability are used in their full strength. The theorem, loosely speaking, says that in a controllable system the dynamic behavior can be changed as desired, in terms of characteristic values, by using appropriate feedback. It forms one of the most elegant results of the course and indeed of the field of Systems and Control.','Mathematical systems theory is concerned with problems related to dynamic phenomena in interaction with their environment. These problems include:\r\nï¿½	Modeling. Obtaining a mathematical model that reflects the main features. A mathematical model may be represented by difference or differential equations, but also by inequalities, algebraic equations, and logical constraints. \r\nï¿½	Analysis and simulation of the mathematical model.\r\nï¿½	Prediction and estimation.\r\nï¿½	Control.

In case it is hard to find a suitable parametric model, a nonparametric model offers a viable alternative. If parametric assumptions are hard to justify and/or rejected by a goodness of fit test, the performance of classical tests (often based on the normal distribution) can be cumbersome. In certain settings, permutation tests are a good alternative. The bootstrap is a general resampling technique that can be used for example to compute standard errors of estimators. \r\n\r\nWeeks 6 up till 13 will be on various aspects of nonparametric regression. The classical linear regression model assumes that the relation between a response variable Y and a predictor variable X can be modeled by a straight line. In practice however, this may not be appropriate. Nonparametric regression aims to fit a curve while making as few assumptions as possible. We will discuss various approaches to this problem, such as local regression and penalized regression. Besides being practically relevant, these methods also raise mathematically interesting questions. If the outcome of an experiment is nonnormal, for example binary (as is often the case in practice), the principles underlying these techniques can also be used. This leads to nonparametric logistic regression. If time permits we will also treat the case of multiple predictors, leading to additive models.\r\n','To obtain a broad knowledge of nonparametric methods in statistics. Many methods in statistics are parametric in nature. In this case the probability law of the data is assumed to be parametrized by a finite-dimensional parameter. The basic idea of nonparametric methods is to drop this assumption and to make as few assumptions as possible. These methods thereby offer much more flexibility to model the data than classical parametric methods. The topics that we will cover in this course form a mix of classical distribution free methods and more modern topics. We focus on application of the methods, though we will discuss some theoretical issues as well. Examples will be illustrated using the statistical computing package R.\r\n'),

One of the key ingredients are the so-called Linear Matrix Inequalities, LMIï¿½s for short. LMIï¿½s can be treated  efficiently by means of semi-definite programming techniques coming from convex optimization.\r\n\r\n It turns out that many properties of linear systems, like stability, controllability, observability, etc., can be formulated in terms of LMIï¿½s. Also the design of controllers satisfying stability and other constraints can be done efficiently using semi-definite programming and LMIï¿½s. The first part of part I starts by recalling basic knowledge from linear system theory and placing it in the frame work of LMIï¿½s. \r\n\r\n A second topic in part I will be LQ optimal control and the introduction of dissipativity. Both topics are of crucial importance for system theory. LQ optimal control has a long and rich history, but is still important and applicable. Dissipativity also has a long history, but its applicability has increased in recent years by the event of new efficient algorithms to solve semi-definite programming problems.\r\n\r\nThe last topic in part I are system norms and the design of a controller such that the combined system behaves in a desired way specified in terms of its norm. To that end, the H-infinity and the H2 norm will be introduced. Also methods will be treated which it can be investigated whether a certain desired norm can be achieved, and how this then actually can be done by means of state or output feedback.\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nThe first fundamental topic to be treated in part II of the course is concerned with the controllability and observability concepts to nonlinear control systems. The key ingredients to analyze controllability of a nonlinear system are the so-called Lie brackets of the associated system vector fields. Observability can be analyzed by considering the (repeated) Lie derivatives of the output mapping with respect to the system vector fields. The necessary mathematical preliminaries are introduced during the lectures.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the course, a variety of modelling and analysis techniques that uses energy as a starting point is presented. Apart from the fact that energy is a fundamental concept in physics, there are several motivations for adopting an energy-based perspective in modeling physical systems. First, since a physical system can be viewed as a set of simpler subsystems that exchange energy among themselves and the environment, it is common to view dynamical systems as energy-transformation devices. Secondly, energy is neither allied to a particular physical domain nor restricted to linear elements and systems. In fact, energies from different domains can be combined simply by adding up the individual energy contributions. Thirdly, energy can serve as a lingua franca to facilitate communication among scientists and engineers from different fields. Lastly, the role of energy and the interconnections between subsystems provide the basis for various control strategies.','Advance system theory deals with the extensions in /of linear system theory. \r\nAfter the course the student will be familiar with the following topics. \r\nï¿½	Convex optimization and linear matrix inequalities \r\nï¿½	LQ optimal control and dissipativity \r\nï¿½	Controller design and the H-infinity norm/H-2 norm \r\nï¿½	Passive systems/ nonlinear control systems and the small-gain theorem\r\nï¿½	Controllability/observability for nonlinear systems and Lie brackets\r\nï¿½	Feedback linearization and involution\r\n'),

	(77,'WB2414-09','Mechatronic System Design','Mechatronic system design deals with the design of controlled motion systems by the integration of functional elements from a multitude of disciplines. It starts with thinking how the required function can be realised by the combination of different subsystems according to a Systems Engineering approach (V-model).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the control principles used in this course place a strong emphasis on frequency domain methods by linearising the system at its working point with the use of Bode- and Nyquist plots. The main reason for this emphasis is the strong focus in other control related courses on (non-linear) time domain related methods while linearised frequency domain related methods are still dominantly applied in the industry. A mechatronic engineer should be able to work with both methods and use them where appropriate.\r\n\r\nSome supporting disciplines, like power-electronics and electromechanics, are not part of the BSc program of mechanical engineers. For this reason this course introduces these disciplines in connection with mechanical dynamics and PID-motion control principles to realise an optimally designed motion system.\r\n\r\nThe target application for the lectures are motion systems that combine high speed movements with extreme precision.\r\n\r\nThe course covers the following four main subjects:\r\n\r\n1: Dynamics of motion systems in the time and frequency domain, including analytical frequency transfer functions that are represented in Bode and Nyquist plots.\r\n\r\n2: Motion control in the frequency domain with PID-feedback and model-based feedforward control-principles that effectively deal with the mechanical dynamic anomalies (resonances and eigenmodes) of the plant.\r\n\r\n3: Electromechanical actuators, mainly based on the electromagnetic Lorentz principle. Reluctance force and piezoelectric actuators will be shortly presented to complete the overview.\r\n\r\n4: Power electronics that are used for driving electromagnetic actuators.\r\n\r\nThe fifth relevant discipline, position measurement systems is dealt with in another course: WB2303, Electronics and measurement.\r\n\r\nThe most important educational element that will be addressed is the necessary knowledge of the physical phenomena that act on motion systems, to be able to critically judge results obtained with simulation software. \r\nThe lectures challenge the capability of students to match simulation models with reality, to translate a real system into a sufficiently simplified dynamic model and use the derived dynamic properties to design a suitable, practically realiseable controller. \r\nThis course increases the understanding what a position control system does in reality in terms of virtual mechanical properties like stiffness and damping that are added to the mechanical plant by a closed loop feedback controller. \r\n\r\nIt is shown how a motion system can be analysed and modelled top-down with approximating (scalar and linearised) calculations by hand, giving a sufficient feel of the problem to make valuable concept design decisions in an early stage. \r\nWith this method students learn to work more efficiently by starting their design with a quick and dirty global analysis to prove feasibility or direct further detailed modelling in specific problem areas.

This device is based on a MOS capacitor to which we will pay attention first. In this transistor the current is led via the source contact through a conductive channel in a semiconductor to the drain contact. The conductivity of the channel can be controlled by changing the bias on the gate contact. Characteristic for this device is that the current-voltage relationship is more linear in contrast to the bipolar transistor where it is exponential.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discussion on ideal MOSFETs, we will then focus on non-ideal characteristics of MOSFETs, like channel-length modulation and short-channel effects. Additionally, we will also pay attention to threshold voltage modification by varying the dopant concentration and MOS scaling. A combination of an n-channel and p-channel MOSFET is used for CMOS devices that form the basis for current digital technology. The operation of a CMOS inverter will be explained. We will explain in more detail how the transfer characteristics relate to the CMOS design.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will also pay attention to photonic devices, like LEDs. Photonic devices rely either on the interaction of charge carriers with light or on light-emitting processes in the device.\r\n','This course aims at a thorough understanding of the physics of semiconductor devices.

	(202,'IN4253ET','\"Hacking Lab\"-Applied Security Analysis','The security of computer and telecommunication systems is becoming an increasing concern. In this course, we will review the current state of the art on security research and gain practical experience in assessing the security and vulnerabilities of communication systems. Engineers are typically taught to focus on performance, correctness, scalability, and maintainability when building communication and information processing systems. However, an additional set of design principles are required to achieve security. In this course, we discuss security principles, common pitfalls and vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nThe weekly lectures provide an introduction into security research, with a focus on real-world security, privacy-enhancing technology and common security pitfalls.\r\n\r\nEach student participates in a \"Hack Project\", with a group of one to four students. Students can select between a wide range of available Hack Project outlines within the first week. The goal may be to evaluate the security of a real-world IT system, developing a proof-of-concept exposing a vulnerability or focussed on preserving privacy in a post-Snowden world. Students may propose their own Hack Project based on their background knowledge and skills. Such Hack Projects need to be approved and shaped together with the instructor. Example of possible outlined hardware-oriented projects are: development of a wifi tracker, programing an FPGA system to break passwords, assess the security of RFID cards, or to transparently intercept Ethernet traffic. Concrete software projects are: hacking Bitcoin, improving the TOR anonymity protocol and create Android-based tools for human rights activists in Iran, Egypt and Russia. \r\n\r\nEach Hack Project is documented with a written report. This can be in the form of a 6-8 page IEEE-style scientific article or a traditional more lengthy report. All results, experiences and findings are presented to the entire class in the last week of the course. Hack Projects also report their progress several times during the course, after the weekly lectures.\r\n','After this course, the student will have a thorough knowledge of security in real-world systems, and will be able to explore the literature on this topic independently. \r\nThe student will be aware of the poor state of security in real-world computer systems. The student can explain the common pitfalls, why these known failures still occur and reasons behind the poor state of security in general.'),
